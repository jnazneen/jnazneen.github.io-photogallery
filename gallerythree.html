        <h5>What an Expression</h5>
        <p>A sisterly bond is very precious. All the laughing, jokes angry, with each other are what creates a strong bond. These pictures are the ones that helped with my bond with my sister. The interlacing hands are the face of frustration. To be more accurate, it’s the face that screams “Api, Seriously. Haven’t we taken enough pictures. Let’s be done with it already!” This pic uses a butterfly lighting with B&W edits. The other image is sweet. I think it was just the beginning of taking pictures. That’s why her face isn’t cranky yet. It uses Rembrandt lighting. It’s in B&W and I did some dodge and burn to bring out the highlights on her face. </p>

        <h5>Beauty and the Rose</h5>
        <p>Does everyone remember the Beauty and the Beast live-action poster? The poster had Belle or Emma Watson staring at a rose. But of course, her face is tilted to the side and you can’t see the front of the rose or her face. This is the same pose but I would say better. This photo uses a prop and a blurred background. There is also a split butterfly under the nose. This image is in B&W but the rose has been masked so that you can see the bright red color of the rose. </p>

        <h5>Capturing Souls</h5>
        <p>Some representative placeholder content for the first slide “Capturing souls” is what Réhahn does with his photographs. Following his lead, I also tried to capture a soul. The eyes are the main focus of the photo with the hands framing the eyes. The hands bring the focus to the eyes. The image is in B&W. The main editing focus for this image was the Dodge and Burn. Since this image is all facial features, dodge and burn needed to be good. Highlights have been dodged with shadows, eyebrows, and eyelashes have been burned.  </p>
