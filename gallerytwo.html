<p class= "lol1"> Black. Black is a shade that everyone loves. No matter how hard you try for it to not work with something else, it never works. This is the color that can mean so many things. This is the black that works with these three backgrounds. Each photograph shows a different meaning of black with its different poses and technique </p>

    <p class= "lol3">The hush shows the secretive side of black. It reminds you of Pretty Little Liars and the theme song right in the beginning. Along with the pose and black background, the Rembrandt creates a triangle on the cheek. The photo is in black and white with dodge and burn to highlight the cheeks and darken the eyelashes and eyebrows. </p>

    <p class= "lol">Last but not the least, is the pop art pose. It reminds me of a pop art portrait that my sister had drawn. It’s definitely not the same but has similarities. It uses loop lighting around the nose. As said before, it has B&W +Dodge and Burn edits.</p>
